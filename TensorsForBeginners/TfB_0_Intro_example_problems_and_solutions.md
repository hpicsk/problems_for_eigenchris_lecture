# TfB 0 Intro: Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1
What is a tensor? Explain in your own words.

## Solution 1
A tensor is a mathematical object that generalizes the concepts of scalars, vectors, and matrices. It is a geometric entity that can be used to describe physical properties and relationships, and its components change in a predictable way under a change of coordinate system.

## Problem 2
What is the order (or rank) of a scalar, a vector, and a matrix?

## Solution 2
- A scalar is a tensor of rank 0.
- A vector is a tensor of rank 1.
- A matrix can be considered a tensor of rank 2.

## Problem 3
Give an example of a physical quantity that can be represented by a scalar, a vector, and a tensor of rank 2.

## Solution 3
- **Scalar:** Temperature, mass, speed.
- **Vector:** Velocity, force, displacement.
- **Tensor of rank 2:** Stress (describes forces in a material), strain (describes deformation), moment of inertia.

## Problem 4
Why are tensors important in fields like physics and engineering? Provide a specific example.

## Solution 4
Tensors are crucial because they allow us to express physical laws in a way that is independent of any particular coordinate system. This is essential for ensuring that our descriptions of the universe are consistent. For example, in Einstein's theory of general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is described by the Riemann curvature tensor.
