## Problem 1
Express the bilinear form $B(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) = (f \cdot \mathbf{v}) \cdot (g \cdot \mathbf{w})$ as a tensor product of two covectors, where $f$ is the covector $(1, 2)$ and $g$ is the covector $(3, 4)$.

## Solution 1
This is the definition of the tensor product of two covectors, $B = f \otimes g$.

## Problem 2
How can a bilinear form be represented as a (0, 2) tensor?

## Solution 2
A bilinear form takes two vectors and produces a scalar. A (0, 2) tensor is a multilinear map that takes two vectors and produces a scalar. Therefore, a bilinear form is a (0, 2) tensor.
