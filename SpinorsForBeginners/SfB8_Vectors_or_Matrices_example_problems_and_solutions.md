This lecture explores the different ways to represent vectors and linear transformations, particularly in the context of spinors and Clifford algebras.

## Problem 1: Vector Representation

A vector in 3D space can be represented as $v = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$.
It can also be represented as a column matrix:
$$v = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}$$

A rotation around the z-axis by an angle $\theta$ is given by the matrix:
$$R_z(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

Given the vector $v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, calculate the new vector $v'$ after a rotation of $\pi/2$ around the z-axis.

### Solution 1

Given $v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and a rotation of $\pi/2$ around the z-axis.

$$R_z(\pi/2) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\pi/2) & -\sin(\pi/2) & 0 \\ \sin(\pi/2) & \cos(\pi/2) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$v' = R_z(\pi/2) v = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$$

## Problem 2: Representing Vectors as Matrices

In the context of Pauli matrices, a 3D vector $v = (x, y, z)$ can be associated with a 2×2 matrix:
$$V = v \cdot \sigma = x\sigma_1 + y\sigma_2 + z\sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} z & x-iy \\ x+iy & -z \end{pmatrix}$$

a) Show that the determinant of this matrix is related to the squared magnitude of the vector: $\det(V) = -|v|^2$.

b) Show that the trace of this matrix is zero: $\text{Tr}(V) = 0$.

### Solution 2

a) **Show that the determinant of this matrix is related to the squared magnitude of the vector: $\det(V) = -|v|^2$.**

$$V = \begin{pmatrix} z & x-iy \\ x+iy & -z \end{pmatrix}$$

$$\det(V) = -z^2 - (x-iy)(x+iy) = -z^2 - (x^2+y^2) = -(x^2+y^2+z^2) = -|v|^2$$

b) **Show that the trace of this matrix is zero: $\text{Tr}(V) = 0$.**

$$\text{Tr}(V) = z + (-z) = 0$$

## Problem 3: Rotations as Matrix Multiplication

A rotation of a vector $v$ can be represented by the action of an SU(2) matrix $U$ on the matrix form $V$:
$$V' = U V U^\dagger$$

Let $U = \exp(-i\frac{\theta}{2}\sigma_3)$ be a rotation around the z-axis.
$$U = \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix}$$

Show that $V'$ corresponds to a vector $v'$ that is rotated by an angle $\theta$ around the z-axis.
Hint: Calculate $V'$ and identify the new components $x', y', z'$.

### Solution 3

$$U = \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix}, \quad U^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} e^{i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix}$$

$$V' = U V U^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} z & x-iy \\ x+iy & -z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} e^{i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix}$$

$$= \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2}z & e^{-i\theta/2}(x-iy) \\ e^{i\theta/2}(x+iy) & -e^{i\theta/2}z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} e^{i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix}$$

$$= \begin{pmatrix} z & e^{-i\theta}(x-iy) \\ e^{i\theta}(x+iy) & -z \end{pmatrix}$$

We have $V' = \begin{pmatrix} z' & x'-iy' \\ x'+iy' & -z' \end{pmatrix}$.

So $z' = z$.

$$x' - iy' = e^{-i\theta}(x-iy) = (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)(x-iy) = (x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta) - i(x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta)$$

Therefore:
$$x' = x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta$$
$$y' = x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta$$

This is the standard formula for a rotation of a vector $(x,y,z)$ by an angle $\theta$ around the z-axis.

## Problem 4: Bivectors as Generators of Rotations

In Clifford algebra, rotations are generated by bivectors. The bivector for a rotation in the xy-plane is $B_{xy} = e_1 e_2$.

The rotation of a vector $v$ is given by $v' = R v R^{-1}$, where $R = \exp(\frac{\theta}{2} e_1 e_2)$.

Using the Clifford algebra for Euclidean 3D space ($e_i e_j = -\delta_{ij} + e_i \wedge e_j$), expand the exponential and show how it rotates the vector $v = x e_1 + y e_2$.

### Solution 4

In Clifford algebra, $e_1 e_2 = e_1 \wedge e_2$. $(e_1 e_2)^2 = e_1 e_2 e_1 e_2 = -e_1 e_1 e_2 e_2 = -1$.

$$R = \exp(\frac{\theta}{2} e_1 e_2) = \cos(\theta/2) + \sin(\theta/2)e_1 e_2$$

$$R^{-1} = \exp(-\frac{\theta}{2} e_1 e_2) = \cos(\theta/2) - \sin(\theta/2)e_1 e_2$$

$$v' = R v R^{-1} = (\cos(\theta/2) + \sin(\theta/2)e_1 e_2)(x e_1 + y e_2)(\cos(\theta/2) - \sin(\theta/2)e_1 e_2)$$

$$= e_1(x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta) + e_2(y\cos\theta + x\sin\theta)$$

This is the rotated vector.

## Problem 5: Philosophical Differences

What are the advantages and disadvantages of representing vectors as column matrices versus representing them as elements of a Clifford algebra (or as matrices like in Problem 2)? Discuss in the context of performing transformations like rotations and boosts.

### Solution 5

**Advantages of column matrices:**
- Familiar and widely taught in linear algebra.
- Simple to implement for numerical calculations.
- Rotations are represented by matrix multiplication, which is a standard operation.

**Disadvantages of column matrices:**
- The representation of a rotation depends on the choice of coordinate system.
- It is not as "geometric" as the Clifford algebra approach.
- Does not generalize as easily to higher dimensions or to other transformations like boosts.

**Advantages of Clifford algebra / matrix representation of vectors:**
- The representation is coordinate-free. The vector is an object in its own right.
- Rotations are performed by sandwiching, which is a more algebraic and arguably more fundamental operation.
- Unifies vectors, bivectors, and other geometric objects into a single algebraic structure.
- Generalizes easily to any dimension and signature, and naturally incorporates Lorentz boosts in spacetime algebra.

**Disadvantages of Clifford algebra / matrix representation of vectors:**
- More abstract and less familiar to many.
- Can be computationally more intensive for simple rotations in 3D compared to matrix multiplication.

In summary, the column vector and matrix approach is practical for many applications in 3D, but the Clifford algebra approach provides a deeper, more unified, and more general framework for geometry and physics.
