## Problem 1

A train is moving with a constant velocity of $20$ m/s with respect to the ground. A person on the train throws a ball in the direction of motion of the train with a velocity of $5$ m/s with respect to the train. What is the velocity of the ball with respect to the ground?

## Solution 1

Let the ground be the stationary frame $S$, and the train be the moving frame $S'$.

The velocity of the train with respect to the ground is $v = 20$ m/s.

The velocity of the ball with respect to the train is $u' = 5$ m/s.

Using the Galilean velocity transformation, the velocity of the ball with respect to the ground is:
$$u = u' + v = 5 \text{ m/s} + 20 \text{ m/s} = 25 \text{ m/s}$$

## Problem 2

Two cars, A and B, are moving towards each other. Car A has a velocity of $30$ m/s and car B has a velocity of $20$ m/s. What is the relative velocity of car A with respect to car B?

## Solution 2

Let the direction of motion of car A be the positive direction.

The velocity of car A is $v_A = 30$ m/s.

The velocity of car B is $v_B = -20$ m/s (negative because it's moving in the opposite direction).

The relative velocity of car A with respect to car B is:
$$v_{AB} = v_A - v_B = 30 \text{ m/s} - (-20 \text{ m/s}) = 50 \text{ m/s}$$

## Problem 3

A boat is moving in a river. The velocity of the boat in still water is $5$ m/s. The velocity of the river flow is $2$ m/s.

a) What is the velocity of the boat when it is moving upstream?

b) What is the velocity of the boat when it is moving downstream?

## Solution 3

Let the velocity of the boat in still water be $v_b = 5$ m/s, and the velocity of the river flow be $v_r = 2$ m/s.

a) When the boat is moving upstream (against the current), its velocity with respect to the ground is:
$$v_{\text{up}} = v_b - v_r = 5 \text{ m/s} - 2 \text{ m/s} = 3 \text{ m/s}$$

b) When the boat is moving downstream (with the current), its velocity with respect to the ground is:
$$v_{\text{down}} = v_b + v_r = 5 \text{ m/s} + 2 \text{ m/s} = 7 \text{ m/s}$$
