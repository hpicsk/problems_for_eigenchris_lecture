# Friedmann Equations - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

Derive the Friedmann equations from the Einstein field equations.

## Solution 1

The Friedmann equations are derived from the Einstein field equations for the FLRW metric.

The first Friedmann equation is:

$$\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2}$$

The second Friedmann equation is:

$$\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3p}{c^2}\right)$$

## Problem 2

What is the critical density of the universe?

## Solution 2

The critical density of the universe is the density for which the geometry of the universe is flat ($k=0$). It is given by:

$$\rho_c = \frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G}$$

where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant.

## Problem 3

Solve the Friedmann equations for a matter-dominated, a radiation-dominated, and a dark energy-dominated universe.

## Solution 3

- Matter-dominated universe ($p=0$): $a(t) \sim t^{2/3}$
- Radiation-dominated universe ($p = \frac{1}{3}\rho c^2$): $a(t) \sim t^{1/2}$
- Dark energy-dominated universe ($p = -\rho c^2$): $a(t) \sim \exp(Ht)$
