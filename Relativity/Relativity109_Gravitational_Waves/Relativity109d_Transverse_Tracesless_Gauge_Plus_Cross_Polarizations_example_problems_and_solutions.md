# Transverse Traceless Gauge, Plus and Cross Polarizations - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What is the transverse traceless gauge?

## Solution 1

The transverse traceless (TT) gauge is a further simplification of the Lorentz gauge for a plane gravitational wave propagating in the z-direction. In the TT gauge, the metric perturbation satisfies the following conditions:

- $h_{\mu\nu} = 0$ for $\mu = 0$ or $\nu = 0$ (transverse)
- $h^\mu_\mu = 0$ (traceless)
- $\partial^\alpha h_{\alpha\mu} = 0$ (Lorentz gauge)
- $h_{\mu z} = 0$ (transverse)

## Problem 2

What are the plus and cross polarizations of a gravitational wave?

## Solution 2

In the TT gauge, a gravitational wave propagating in the z-direction has only two non-zero components: $h_{xx} = -h_{yy}$ and $h_{xy} = h_{yx}$. These two components correspond to the plus and cross polarizations of the gravitational wave.

- Plus polarization: $h_+ = h_{xx} = -h_{yy}$
- Cross polarization: $h_\times = h_{xy} = h_{yx}$

## Problem 3

Show that a gravitational wave has two independent polarizations.

## Solution 3

A general gravitational wave can be written as a superposition of the plus and cross polarizations. The metric perturbation has 10 independent components. The gauge conditions reduce the number of independent components to 2. These two components correspond to the two independent polarizations of the gravitational wave.
