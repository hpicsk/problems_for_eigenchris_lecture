## Problem 1

State the weak equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle.

## Solution 1

The weak equivalence principle states that the inertial mass and gravitational mass of any object are equal. This means that all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field, regardless of their mass or composition.

The strong equivalence principle states that the laws of physics are the same in all freely falling frames. This means that it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform gravitational field and a uniform acceleration.

## Problem 2

Explain the thought experiment of a person in a closed elevator. How does it illustrate the equivalence principle?

## Solution 2

Consider a person in a closed elevator. If the elevator is at rest on the surface of the Earth, the person will feel their normal weight. If the elevator is accelerating upwards in deep space with an acceleration of $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, the person will also feel their normal weight. According to the equivalence principle, there is no experiment the person can do inside the elevator to distinguish between these two situations.

## Problem 3

What is gravitational redshift? How can it be derived from the equivalence principle?

## Solution 3

Gravitational redshift is the phenomenon where the frequency of light decreases as it moves out of a gravitational field. This can be derived from the equivalence principle. Consider a light source at the bottom of a tower and a detector at the top. According to the equivalence principle, this is equivalent to a light source and a detector in a rocket accelerating upwards. The detector is moving away from the light source, so the light will be redshifted due to the Doppler effect.
