# Relativity 107d: Newton Cartan Theory - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

What is Newton-Cartan theory? How is it a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity?

## Solution 1

Newton-Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime, similar to general relativity. However, in Newton-Cartan theory, time is absolute, and the geometry of space is Euclidean.

## Problem 2

What is the role of the metric tensor in Newton-Cartan theory?

## Solution 2

In Newton-Cartan theory, there are two metric tensors: a temporal metric $t_{ab}$ and a spatial metric $h^{ab}$. The temporal metric measures time intervals, and the spatial metric measures spatial distances.

## Problem 3

How is the gravitational field represented in Newton-Cartan theory?

## Solution 3

The gravitational field is represented by a connection on the spacetime manifold. The connection is compatible with the temporal and spatial metrics. The geodesics of this connection are the paths of freely falling particles.
