## Problem 1

What is the energy-momentum tensor? What does it represent?

## Solution 1

The energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ is a tensor quantity that describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime. The component $T_{00}$ is the energy density, $T_{0i}$ is the momentum density, and $T_{ij}$ is the stress tensor.

## Problem 2

What is the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid?

## Solution 2

The energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is:
$$T_{\mu\nu} = (\rho + p/c^2) U_\mu U_\nu + p g_{\mu\nu}$$
where $\rho$ is the energy density, $p$ is the pressure, and $U_\mu$ is the four-velocity of the fluid.

## Problem 3

What is the conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor?

## Solution 3

The conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor is $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$. This is a statement of the local conservation of energy and momentum.
