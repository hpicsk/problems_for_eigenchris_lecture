# Relativity 103e: Problems With Galilean Relativity - Example Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1

The speed of light is measured to be $c$ in all inertial frames. Show that this is inconsistent with the Galilean transformation.

## Solution 1

According to the Galilean transformation, if a light pulse is moving with velocity $c$ in frame $S$, its velocity in a frame $S'$ moving with velocity $v$ with respect to $S$ would be:

$$c' = c - v$$

This contradicts the experimental fact that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames.

## Problem 2

Maxwell's equations are not invariant under the Galilean transformation. Explain the implications of this.

## Solution 2

Maxwell's equations predict that the speed of light in vacuum is a constant, $c = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}$.

If Maxwell's equations were invariant under Galilean transformations, the speed of light would be different in different inertial frames. This would mean that the laws of electromagnetism would be different in different inertial frames, which violates the principle of relativity.

## Problem 3

Describe the Michelson-Morley experiment and its result. How did this experiment challenge the assumptions of Galilean relativity?

## Solution 3

The Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to detect the motion of the Earth through the luminiferous ether, a hypothetical medium through which light was supposed to propagate. 

The experiment used an interferometer to compare the speed of light in two perpendicular directions. The experiment found no difference in the speed of light, which was inconsistent with the idea of a stationary ether and the Galilean transformation. 

This result was a major piece of evidence against the ether theory and led to the development of special relativity.
