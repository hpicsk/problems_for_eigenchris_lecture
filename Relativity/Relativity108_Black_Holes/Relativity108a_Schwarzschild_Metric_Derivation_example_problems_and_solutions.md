## Problem 1

Starting from the vacuum Einstein field equations, derive the Schwarzschild metric.

## Solution 1

The vacuum Einstein field equations are $R_{\mu\nu} = 0$.

We look for a spherically symmetric solution. The most general spherically symmetric metric can be written as:

$$ds^2 = -A(r) c^2 dt^2 + B(r) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)$$

Solving the vacuum Einstein field equations for this metric, we get the Schwarzschild metric:

$$ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right) c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)$$

## Problem 2

What are the assumptions made in the derivation of the Schwarzschild metric?

## Solution 2

The assumptions made in the derivation of the Schwarzschild metric are:

1. The spacetime is spherically symmetric.

2. The spacetime is static (time-independent).

3. The spacetime is asymptotically flat (it approaches Minkowski spacetime at large distances).

4. The solution is a vacuum solution (the energy-momentum tensor is zero).

## Problem 3

What is the Schwarzschild radius? What is its physical significance?

## Solution 3

The Schwarzschild radius is $r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$. It is the radius of the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. For any object with a physical radius smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, the object will be a black hole.
