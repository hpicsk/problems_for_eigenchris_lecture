## Problem 1

Derive the formula for the gravitational frequency shift.

## Solution 1

The frequency of a photon is given by $\omega = -k_\mu U^\mu$, where $k_\mu$ is the wave covector and $U^\mu$ is the four-velocity of the observer.

For a stationary observer in the Schwarzschild metric, $U^\mu = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2GM/rc^2}}, 0, 0, 0\right)$.

The wave covector is $k_\mu = (-\omega_e, k_r, 0, 0)$, where $\omega_e$ is the frequency at emission.

The frequency measured by the observer at radius $r$ is:

$$\omega_o = -k_\mu U^\mu = \frac{\omega_e}{\sqrt{1-2GM/rc^2}}$$

The frequency shift is:

$$z = \frac{\omega_e - \omega_o}{\omega_o} = \sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}} - 1$$

## Problem 2

A photon is emitted from the surface of a star and travels to a distant observer. Will its frequency be shifted? If so, how?

## Solution 2

Yes, the frequency will be shifted. As the photon moves away from the star, it loses energy, so its frequency decreases. This is a gravitational redshift.

## Problem 3

How can covector fields be used to describe the gravitational frequency shift?

## Solution 3

The wave covector $k_\mu$ is a covector field. The frequency of the photon is the projection of this covector field onto the four-velocity of the observer. The change in the frequency as the photon propagates is described by the geodesic equation for the wave covector.
